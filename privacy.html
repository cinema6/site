This Privacy Policy applies to information that you provide to us when you use our Services as a member of our "Publisher" or "Contributor" Program, as well as when you access or use any information or content appearing on the Cinema6 Site, whether as a "Registered User" or as a non-registered user just browsing the Cinema6 Site (a "Visitor"). This Privacy Policy also explains what type of information is collected if you visit third party websites serving content tagged by Publishers or Contributors with Cinema6 Code. We may change the Privacy Policy from time to time. Please consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates.

                                We require Publishers and Contributors to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information when first becoming a Registered User. We may also request additional Personally Identifiable Information from time to time thereafter. Providing such additional Personally Identifiable Information is entirely optional, although some Cinema6 Site features may not work without it.
